<!-- ***CSS Google Fonts Import***

Google Fonts : https://fonts.google.com/  is a free library of web fonts that you can use in your CSS by referencing the font's URL.

from the above we can use the Lobster font in your CSS by using 'Lobster' as the 'FAMILY_NAME' as in the following example:

' font-family: FAMILY_NAME, GENERIC_NAME; '.

The GENERIC_NAME is optional, and is a fallback font in case the other specified font is not available.
-->

<!-- WARNING: Family names are case-sensitive and need to be wrapped in quotes if there is a space in the name. For example,
 you need quotes to use the "Open Sans" font, but not to use the Lobster font.  -->

<style>
  h2{
    font-family:Lobster,monospace;
  }
  .red-text{
    color: red;
  }
  .blue-text{
    color: blue;
    font-family:Helvetica;
  }
  p{
    font-size: 18px;
    font-family: sans-serif;
  }
  .lite-border{
    border-color: green;
    border-width:10px;
    border-style: solid;
  }
</style>

<p class="blue-text lite-border"> *** GENRIC_FONTS ***

 <br>There are several default fonts that are available in all browsers.
 These generic font families include monospace, serif and sans-serif
<br>When one font isn't available, you can tell the browser to "degrade" to another font.

For example, if you wanted an element to use the Helvetica font,
but degrade to the sans-serif font when Helvetica wasn't available, you will specify it as follows:

<br><i>' p {
   <br>font-family: Helvetica, sans-serif;
 <br>} '</i>

 <br>Generic font family names are not case-sensitive. Also, they do not need quotes because they are CSS keywords.

<h2> Applying Multiple Classes</h2>
Remember that you can apply multiple classes to an element using its class attribute, by separating each class name with a space. For example:
&lt img class="class1 class2" &gt
<p class="blue-text">
  styling the app using Classes
</p>
